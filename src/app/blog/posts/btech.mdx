So, the final year is about to start rn (in a few days). For now, Iâ€™m just revising my Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts and brushing up on DSA and DBMS. Since Iâ€™m already good with C++ and Python, I thought maybe I should learn a new programming language this summer or during the semester, like Julia or Rust. I had some ideas in mind, but theyâ€™re too big to start right now â€˜cause Iâ€™ve gotta land an internship first.

Also, Iâ€™m super happy â€˜cause Iâ€™ve contributed to (and solved) some issues on [Mermaid.js](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid), and the owner added me as a collaborator! So yeahhh, Iâ€™m now an official maintainer of that project. First big open source win, and it feels so good.

I really have to finish my research on using CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism) for the Alzheimerâ€™s project Iâ€™m working on.

These days, my health hasnâ€™t been great â€˜cause of the monsoon. Feeling kinda cozy and sleepy a lot. A couple of days ago, I thought Iâ€™d start practicing DSA on LeetCode, but I couldnâ€™t keep it up (streak broke after 5 days, lol). Iâ€™m really tired of feeling low on energy. Gotta make a comeback in academics, spend more time coding, and stay productive, or unemployment is gonna eat me up ðŸ˜­!

Writing this blog purely outta boredom. Idk if Iâ€™ll ever push this live or not, but yeahâ€¦ here it is.
