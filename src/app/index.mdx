{/* Hey there */}
Welcome to my personal space. I’m Kedar—though around here, you might just see me as `wtfkedar`. This is where I quietly document my journey through side projects, AI experiments, [writings](/blog), [projects](/projects), and other bits of tech and life.

{/* The Work */}
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with expertise in AI development, graduated from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology (VIT), Pune. Currently, I work as a freelance DevOps and AI/ML engineer, specializing in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and advanced machine learning techniques. I'm always open to that next opportunity—whether it's a full-time role or a cool internship. I enjoy exploring new ideas, like the subtle intricacies behind the [AlphaQubit](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/alphaqubit-quantum-error-correction/) research, without making a big fuss about it.

{/* Let’s Connect */}
If you’re interested in discussing ideas, collaborating, or just exchanging thoughts, feel free to drop by my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wtfkedar) or reach out at <RevealMail placeholder="my email" isLink={true} />.

Thanks for stopping by—take your time exploring.

[Kedar](/).
