{/* Hi */}
Hi, welcome to my corner of the internet! I am Kedar and I go by `wtfkedar` on most places online, IK it sounds bit cringe >_< .

{/* Prev Work */}
I am currently working on my side-projects and searching for internship/full time oportunities. Also, I work as freelance Devops and AI/ML engineer.

{/* What I am doing right now */}
These days, I am trying to keep up with the research and applied side of AI. My goal right now is to get really good at understanding the [AlphaQubit](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/alphaqubit-quantum-error-correction/) research in the field and dive deeper into the `rabbit holes` of parts that interest me.

{/* What is this site about */}
This site is a place to keep a track of my thoughts, [writings](/blog), [learnings](/ai-log), [projects](/projects) and [everything else](/misc) that I feel I should document and share. Over time, I hope to have built a collection of cool stuff that I have learned from and which I can [look back to](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc?si=SKb-Z4M-Jl1N1u52&t=297) and be proud of.

{/* How can you contact me */}
If you want to chat, build something interesting together, or hire me, you can [hit me a dm on twitter](https://twitter.com/wtfkedar) or mail me at <RevealMail placeholder="my email" isLink={true} />. I am open to project collaborations, part-time gigs, and full-time roles in Applied AI Engineering.

{/* What I do in my free time */}


Feel free to look around!
