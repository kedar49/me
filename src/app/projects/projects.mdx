## Snake's & The Golden Apple

[Snake's & The Golden Apple](https://github.com/kedar49/Snake-Apple) is a competitive, AI-driven game where two snakes learn to navigate, collect food, and avoid collisions using [Deep Q-Learning](https://medium.com/@samina.amin/deep-q-learning-dqn-71c109586bae). This project demonstrates reinforcement learning in a dynamic environment, showcasing how agents evolve their strategies over time.
