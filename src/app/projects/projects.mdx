## Detailed Project Descriptions

### Snake's & The Golden Apple

[Snake's & The Golden Apple](https://github.com/kedar49/Snake-Apple) is a competitive, AI-driven game where two snakes learn to navigate, collect food, and avoid collisions using [Deep Q-Learning](https://medium.com/@samina.amin/deep-q-learning-dqn-71c109586bae). This project demonstrates reinforcement learning in a dynamic environment, showcasing how agents evolve their strategies over time.

### Cybur

[Cybur](https://medium.com/@wtfkedar/cybur-my-journey-into-kernel-level-programming-3cf6d673fa73) is a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) designed to detect and prevent ARP Poisoning Attacks. It intercepts ARP packets, validates their authenticity, and cross-references them with a dynamically maintained DHCP snooping table to secure the ARP cache.

### Image Super-Resolution GAN

[Image Super-Resolution GAN](https://github.com/kedar49/) employs a Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network to convert low-resolution images into high-quality, photo-realistic outputs.

### Neural Black - Brain Tumor Diagnosis System

[Neural Black - Brain Tumor Diagnosis System](https://github.com/kedar49/) is an end-to-end solution for detecting, classifying, and diagnosing brain tumors. It leverages advanced Deep Learning methods to achieve high diagnostic accuracy.

### Third Eye - Intrusion Detection System

[Third Eye - Intrusion Detection System](https://github.com/kedar49/) integrates a firewall with Machine Learning algorithms to analyze network traffic and detect potential intrusions, enhancing overall network security.

### Malware Prediction

[Malware Prediction](https://github.com/kedar49/) utilizes Machine Learning techniques to assess portable executable applications, predicting whether they are malware or at risk of being attacked.
