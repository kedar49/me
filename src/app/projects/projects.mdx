## Detailed Project Descriptions

### Pelvix AI ðŸ¤–

[Pelvix AI](https://github.com/kedar49/Pelvix) is your digital best friend powered by AI - a modern, full-stack chatbot with personality built with Next.js 15 and React 19. Features include intelligent chat powered by DeepSeek-R1 via Pollinations AI, high-quality image generation with `/imagine` commands, smooth GSAP-powered animations, and a warm, friendly personality. The application includes real-time chat functionality, custom dark themes, robust error handling, and is optimized for performance and responsiveness across all devices.

### X-Bird - AI Tweet Reply Generator

[X-Bird](https://github.com/kedar49/x-bird) is a Chrome extension that generates smart, contextual tweet replies on X.com using AI. Powered by Hugging Face's Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct model (Alibaba's 72B parameter model), it features multiple mood options (Auto, Savage, Supportive, Funny, Professional, Casual), adjustable brainrot intensity control (0-100), intelligent tweet filtering for high-engagement content, secure API key storage, and seamless UI integration with Twitter's interface.

### RAG Application System

[RAG Application](https://github.com/kedar49/RAG-Application) is a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. This system enhances AI responses by incorporating relevant information from external databases, significantly improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations. The architecture includes vector embeddings, semantic search capabilities, and intelligent knowledge integration for contextually relevant responses.

### Snake's & The Golden Apple

[Snake's & The Golden Apple](https://github.com/kedar49/Snake-Apple) is a competitive, AI-driven game where two snakes learn to navigate, collect food, and avoid collisions using [Deep Q-Learning](https://medium.com/@samina.amin/deep-q-learning-dqn-71c109586bae). This project demonstrates reinforcement learning in a dynamic environment, showcasing how agents evolve their strategies over time.

### Cybur

[Cybur](https://medium.com/@wtfkedar/cybur-my-journey-into-kernel-level-programming-3cf6d673fa73) is a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) designed to detect and prevent ARP Poisoning Attacks. It intercepts ARP packets, validates their authenticity, and cross-references them with a dynamically maintained DHCP snooping table to secure the ARP cache.

### Image Super-Resolution GAN

[Image Super-Resolution GAN](https://github.com/kedar49) employs a Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network to convert low-resolution images into high-quality, photo-realistic outputs.

### Neural Black - Brain Tumor Diagnosis System

[Neural Black - Brain Tumor Diagnosis System](https://github.com/kedar49) is an end-to-end solution for detecting, classifying, and diagnosing brain tumors. It leverages advanced Deep Learning methods to achieve high diagnostic accuracy.

### Third Eye - Intrusion Detection System

[Third Eye - Intrusion Detection System](https://github.com/kedar49) integrates a firewall with Machine Learning algorithms to analyze network traffic and detect potential intrusions, enhancing overall network security.

### Malware Prediction

[Malware Prediction](https://github.com/kedar49) utilizes Machine Learning techniques to assess portable executable applications, predicting whether they are malware or at risk of being attacked.
